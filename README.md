# नमस्ते, I'm Vikash Gupta 🙏🏻

I’m a Computer Science engineer who loves building simple and useful things. I try to keep learning step by step — every project, every bug, every new tool teaches me something new. That’s the fun part of this field.

🚀 What I’m into right now

- **Full-Stack Development →** I enjoy working on complete applications, from frontend to backend. I try to make them fast, reliable, and easy to use.
- **Backend & System Design →** I find backend really exciting — designing APIs, working with microservices, and thinking about how systems will scale when more people start using them.
- **Problem Solving →** I like solving LeetCode questions as a game. Haven’t been regular lately, but I’m planning to get back to it soon. Breaking big problems into smaller steps and solving them is something I genuinely enjoy.
- **Exploring LLMs →** These days, I’m experimenting with Large Language Models — building small proof-of-concepts to see how they can fit into real applications and automate boring tasks.

I’ve also started writing about my learnings in React and other technologies on medium. Writing helps me clear my own understanding, and if it helps someone else along the way, that’s even better. You can find them [here](https://hiimvikash.medium.com/)
