# नमस्ते, I'm Vikash Gupta 🙏🏻

I’m a Computer Science engineer who enjoys building things that are useful and simple. I like solving practical problems and making applications that actually help in real scenarios.

I try to keep learning new technologies and improve step by step, because every project teaches me something new.

My background in Data Structures and Algorithms gives me a good base to think logically and build solutions that can work better as they grow.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **Full-Stack Development:** I work on complete web applications, from frontend to backend. I use modern frameworks and tech, and try to make apps which are strong, fast and easy to use.

- **Backend & System Design:** I really enjoy backend part. I design APIs, work with microservices, and think about how system will scale when users grow. Also like solving problem of distributed system.

- **Problem Solving:** I have strong base in Data Structures and Algorithms, because I did lot of LCs Qs. So I am good at breaking big problems into small parts and solving them.

These days I am learning about Large Language Models (LLMs) and building small proof-of-concepts to see how they can be used in real apps and also how can I automate few tasks by providing tools to LLMs.

Along with that, I’ve started writing on Medium about my learnings in React and other technologies. Whatever I explore, I try to make a blog out of it — so it’s useful for others and also helps me understand things better. You can find them [here](https://hiimvikash.medium.com/)
